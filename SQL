SQL - Structured Query Language - Relation DB

SELECT * FROM table_name # SELECT column FROM table_name, * - all column
SELECT west AS "West Region" FROM tutorial.us_housing_units # AS renames column as you want
LIMIT 100 # Limits rows for 100 lines, if you don't need the whole table by several reasons
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE west > 10 # Obvious
LIKE # Sensetive to Capital and lower-case letters
ILIKE # Unsensetive
'%word%' in link LIKE # Searches the similiar word in the middle of expression


Note: the clauses always need to be in this order: SELECT, FROM, WHERE.
Note: If you're using an operator with values that are non-numeric, you need to put the value in single quotes: 'value'
    LIKE allows you to match similar values, instead of exact values.
    IN allows you to specify a list of values you'd like to include.
    BETWEEN allows you to select only rows within a certain range.
    IS NULL allows you to select rows that contain no data in a given column.
    AND allows you to select only rows that satisfy two conditions.
    OR allows you to select rows that satisfy either of two conditions.
    NOT allows you to select rows that do not match a certain condition.
